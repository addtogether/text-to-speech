<ul>
<li>This is javascript app which converts text entered into speech using Web Speech API.</li>

<li>It works by getting the user text and then calling the function textToSpeech() with passing user text as an argument. Inside this function, using the speech synthesis property of the window object, the entered text gets converted to speech. Speech Synthesis is a web speech API that controls the speech service.</li>

<li>It also gets all available voices from the user device using the getVoices() method of Speech Synthesis and insert it into dropdown where user can select a particular voice to use.</li>
</ul>
